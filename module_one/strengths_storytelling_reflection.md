# Strengths & Storytelling Reflection Guidelines

Build on your professional story by thinking about how you're progressing at Turing. Answer the questions below in your own gist to use your StrengthsFinder themes to add to your story:

* Write 1-2 paragraphs about your StrengthsFinder themes:
      How have you seen yourself using these strengths at Turing? Has your understanding of these strengths changed since you first reflected on them? If so, how? 
      I think my responsibility leads me to keep promises to those around me.  It drives me during group projects, as does my strategy.  I like to combine different skill sets to create the most cohesive project possible.
      Not particularly, I don't feel as if my understanding of my strengths has changed.  My application, however, may have altered due to the nature of the problem, at the time.

* Write a story about your Turing experience so far:
    When have you struggled? How have you dealt with struggle? When have you succeeded at Turing? How did you accomplish those successes?
    I have always struggled at Turing.  Although I am interested in interacting socially with people, I find that I often question my daily interactions.  I have struggled with self-confidence because of my current home-life.  I'll feel like I can do anything, and then after a trip home, I question everything.
    I think I've succeeded in being a good partner.  I try to be responsible with my time, as well as theirs, and manage our progress so as to complete our intended goal.  Honestly, I think I accomplished it by sheer will.  It was something I wanted to do, and I made it happen through a concious effort, and paying attention to other's needs and concerns.

* Answer the question: how does your Turing story end? Create a vision for your future and your career transition into being a junior developer.
      I'd like to graduate Turing and work in some kind of science environment.  I have an idea for an application concerning brachiopods, their dating, and finding a corresponding time period in the fossil record.  I'd love to work on a team where this is a possibility to implement, eventually. 

* After you practice storytelling in the session, answer this question:
      What was particularly easy or difficult about telling your story? What are 1-2 steps that you can take to continue to improve your abilities to tell your story, talk about yourself with ease, and examine your strengths?
      Honestly? I reflect upon myself, so as not to harm others around me, but doing it to further my own agenda seems like a foreign concept.  I can sell myself as a business woman, but it's difficult to know what the tech field wants, and how to adjust accordingly.  I don't feel as if I'm 'selling out' because I'm not compromising myself, but I want to be able to set goals to meet the needs of the company, instead of settling for a different job because I'm scared I won't be able to fulfill their requirements.  That goes back to the confidence.  I'm not trying to say I'd misrepresent myself in order to get a job, but instead be able to accurately portray my current abilities, without consistently doubting myself.
